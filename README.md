## Project Type
As was proposed, we have pursued Project-option 2, and have also complemented the research with 3 small implementations.
- For the implementations: we have created 3 new engines for selective symbolic execution (2 versions) and dynamic symbolic execution (1 version) in WLANG; and compared their results against the ones we achieved in Assignment 2 for static symbolic execution.
